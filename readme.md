## About Noujontro

Source Code of www.noujontro.com I developed this site in 2017 to archive the course materials such as Books, Class notes, Chothas and question papers for all of the theoretical and sessional courses which are taught in different Level-Terms by the department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, BUET. I used PHP based web framework laravel 5 to develope it. One notable thing about the development of this website is that I have used Google Drive API V3 to host all the files of this site. The site itself is hosted on Heroku. I have tried my best to make a wonderful site for the students of my department though I did not possess a lot skill in web developing at that time!! Due to continuous development, the site I have developed is replaced by the one currents students of the department have developed. Although, mine could still be found at: https://namepedia.herokuapp.com. Along with this one, I have also developed another site for INTER UNIVERSITY MODEL SHIP PROPULSION COMEPETITION 2018. That could be found at: http://mspc.noujontro.com/. I have only included source code for the first one.
